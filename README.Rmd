# Flux measurements

This is a small project to process data from the EGM4 IRGA.
A work in progress, mainly personal project.

Currently there is a file for processing cleaned data. A script to process raw-data from the EGM4, merge it with other measurements of the same day and merge it with data from a TinyTag temperature logger and PAR Photon Flux Sensor coupled to a EM50 logger station is in the works.

Future work incl. expanding to the EGM5 which has a slightly different file system.

# The EGM4

The EGM4 only stores 1000 lines of data internally and therefore several files might be generated during one days measurements.

As I have not been using a standard size chamber, the volume is not the same as the chamber from PP systems. This is among the factors that — for now — need to be manually set.
